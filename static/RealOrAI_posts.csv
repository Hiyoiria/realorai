It has the classic grainy buttercup-colored filter look we all know and love. 2. Some lines either become smeary messes or don't appear at all. 3. Here, there is one glaring inconsistency that I saw: the number of pancakes went from 6 to 4. There are more in the webtoon; In the first episode, for example, the fridge is square like the 3d model and has fridge pictures on it. Here, the fridge is rounded with no fridge pictures.

He will be surrounded by followers, disciples, or symbolic figures (seated around, praying, listening, or interacting). Similar to the attached reference. Background with nature (trees, flowers, animals, huts or temples). Ornamental border with repeating floral/mandala motifs. Subtle mystical/surreal details (smoke patterns, glowing symbols, celestial motifs, sacred geometry, etc.). Original artwork, not stock mashups, not AI. The central character should look like a spiritual leader or enigmatic figure, but not tied to any specific religion. More universal/mystical.""

For context, the World Expo is supposed to showcase each country's culture and/or technological innovations. Inside the Australia Pavilion are a few rooms which have animations of Australian animals. The first few photos attached are from the first room, which is a sort of forest diorama with animations of animals in the tree hollows. They were far away, but I started to get an AI vibe from them when I noticed the baby koala seemed to have too many arm joints. I also included a zoomed-out pic of the room to show you what it looked like. I also have some video I took from another room, which I will attach to a second post. I feel like these could be AI because the animals all look and move strangely and I don't think that a real animator would do that. I also looked into the Australia Pavilion and while it was easy to find the name of the Pavilion's architect, there was no mention of a digital artist for the animated content. I would love to know what you think. Personally, if it is AI then I feel a little disappointed.

1n7eura,[HELP] not sure if this is (good quality) AI or I'm going crazy seeing AI where it doesn't exist. Appears to depict violence.,0,Reality_Sift,2025-09-03 13:29:44,"So for context, someone that I know shared this video from another Facebook account, so it's probably done the rounds. But this is the source uploader in frame -from what I can tell- (not sure why it says ""following""). I'm not sure if I'm going mad and seeing AI where AI isn't, which I think a lot of people are starting to feel. Or whether some of this AI content is just getting really really good at not being easily identifiable to the general public on social media at least. I can't help but feel that some of this looks ""wrong"" in some way, beyond the obvious of what it appears to depict. Which I don't think is relevant (one assumes that -if real- that it was handed to police etc, lots of comments so 🤷‍♂️) Some of the things that -I think- I can see but I can't draw a circle around so to speak... Taking a wider view and looking at the positions of people's feet when jumping around relative to their bodies, some of this looks like the feet (and sometimes bodies) are doing some impossible movements. I've tried looking for frames where there are more or fewer fingers than normal. I can't quite find a definitive frame of this, however the boy at the start who places his right hand at the back-top of his right leg... the last few frames of that hand position look like there might be slightly too many fingers almost rendered. And in general it looks like people's hands are moving around and deforming just a little bit too much and too ""oddly"". Also phones and other items in hands seem to mask hand weirdnesses. There's a moment in the middle where the two older men have a sort of clipping moment with their arms and this transition looks a little bit odd to me as well. The main subject older gentleman also does a little bit of a jump at one point that looks a little too far for him. In general, it looks as though a lot of people's movements take place when their view is obstructed by somebody else. I've doubted myself many times on this video and honestly I am flip-flopping between real and I'm going mad, or AI but very good.

It's possible that they use the name elsewhere and it's just not on websites indexed by google, though. * The last two images I posted were titled as twins (~~link removed~~), but it feels like they were just two outputs of the same prompt. * The filenames for a bunch of the pieces are variants of ""seren-woshixiaotiancai-anime-girl-wearing-tight-sharp-black-armor-w-8c482f25-3712-4e86-8824-829766593a10-3"" (replace black with another colour), which feels like a weird way to title your art. The ""anime girl whatever"" plus random numbers and letters feel like something a generative AI software would automatically title it based on the prompt. I've googled ""woshixiaotiancai"", but nothing useful came up. It looks like it's Chinese, but I don't know the language so I'm just guessing. Not sure if it's their name. * Some of the recent pieces (especially those with ""sketches"") could very easily be made by generative AI these days. I've shared my suspicions in a post of their art, so I thought I'd seek other opinions.

1mqlxq3,[HELP] UPDATE Graphic Designer using AI?,364,Annamaca,2025-08-15 03:13:10,"I posted here a little over a week ago about a graphic designer I hired who might have used AI for my logo. Normally I am fine with AI in design, but I chose this person because their Etsy shop specifically says they hand draw all their logos. After comments on my last post I decided that it must be AI generated. I only paid $30, so I was not expecting anything amazing, but I did want something custom and not something I could have done myself with ChatGPT (which I cannot use for this project due to restrictions). When I asked if it was AI, here is how it went: **Him:** Thank you so much for your comments on the design :) I am making these changes and sending you the revised logo design. *\*sends logo from my first post\** **Me:** Thank you, I still would like some changes but I was wondering, was this created using Al? I was expecting a custom design made by you, so I just wanted to check. Let me know, thanks! **Him:** Oh no you can let me know the changes i am doing new design i use adobe illustrator to do the hand drawn design, i do not use Ai **Me:** *\*Doesn't reply because it feels sus\** **Him:** \**Sends ""new"" logo\** (photo in this post) The new logo 1. I did not ask for any changes 2. It is worse than the first one 3. It still looks AI generated, for example the horn and the ears do not make sense My question Could this have been in his step by step process where he takes my ideas, puts them into an AI image generator, and then uses that image to hand draw his own version? Overall, I just stopped contacting him. Not worth the trouble or the time. I may leave a bad review but I hate being that person, I know this guy is just trying to make a living.

After clicking I noticed the album art was probably Al or maybe like super airbrushed? But probably Al. On the artist page there were no other songs which was suspicious. I googled the artist and they're actually known for musicals and stuff so I though maybe they were just starting on Spotify or something, but then I noticed the name is spelled slightly different, and the actually girl has the original song on her much more famous Spotify profile. My real question then is this like an Al remix? I really dislike the idea of that but I do enjoy the fake song, but I definitely feel weird knowing it's not the original and more than likely Al. I hate how normal it sounds though, I'm not practiced at spotting Al music and maybe this one sounds quite remixy but I figured there'd be some tells of it not being a real person singing. It does kinda start out sounding like a guy singing and then the chorus sounds more like a woman with no distinct switch between the two?

Also, after about twenty minutes the video has no timestamps over the progress bar anymore.

Their discography lists 2 EPs but almost 200 tracks released in the last two years.

I know AI music is increasingly common but I don't know the tells - I did notice a lot of the tracks seem lyrically very shallow and musically somewhat generic. I'm so curious how much of this band is real vs. AI-generated....is this a real musical group that is relying too much on image filters?

I basically bought this shirt at a Nothingmore concert when they were touring with disturbed earlier this year. When I got it I could only see it from far away and it looked normal. I am wearing it for the first time and i caught a glance in the mirror and immediately saw there was something wrong upclose. The way the clothes fold and the wings make me think this is 99.9% an Ai generated image. It's such a bummer too because I like nothing more I really like their music, but at this rate if they use Ai on clothes and merch then how do I know they aren't using Ai for their music too? I'm mostly upset I spent 45$ on this shirt without realizing it at first because it was on a wall far behind the register. It sucks cause I was going to go to a concert for them next year when they were on tour and now I'm probably not going to. I should have just gotten the disturbed shirt instead even tho I'm not as big of a fan tbh. I'm an artist and I feel silly that I can't 100% tell right now if it is or isn't.
